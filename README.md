# SolidPress :construction_sign: WIP

SolidPress is a static site generating framework powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [solidjs](solidjs.com), heavily inspired by [vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress).

Currently it was just an idea of my own and its probably going to be a long journey for this to be able to work.
